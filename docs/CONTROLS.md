# Controls

<!-- Generated from apps/web/src/lib/controls.ts by `npx tsx scripts/export-controls.ts` (in apps/web). Do not edit by hand: a test fails when this file and the game disagree. -->

These are the default keys. Every keyboard action can be rebound in **Settings → Key bindings**, and the game shows your own keys in prompts, hints and the in-game **How to play**. Aim, crouch and interact can each be **hold** or **toggle** (Settings → Controls).

## Field rules

- Hold the use key on ammunition crates and medical cases to take them; magazines dropped by guards and their weapons can be taken too.
- Cargo cases are physical: carry up to 3, each slows you about 10% (a seized recovery case, 20%).
- At the extraction zone, hold the use key to call it in, then stay inside for 8 seconds. Leaving the zone bleeds the countdown; going down drops what you carry.
- Only cargo carried through a completed extraction counts. A raid bounty needs at least half the manifest.
- Practice and Training are unscored and never touch NEAR. Live contracts settle on NEAR testnet; "Settled on NEAR" appears only once the transaction is confirmed.
