/**
 * Radio voices over the fight.
 *
 * The story arrives as voices on the channel, never as a screen you must visit:
 *
 *   KESTREL  — your contract handler. Calm, transactional, on your side as long
 *              as the contract is.
 *   VANGUARD — Vanguard command. The faction whose convoys you hit;
 *              it notices, and it talks about what it will do next.
 *   VEX      — the independent merchant who buys what you take. Friendly in the
 *              way a business is friendly.
 *   ASHEN    — the Ashen Compact, fuel refiners and Vanguard's rival. Zealous,
 *              short sentences, fire and ash.
 *
 * On a live contract the server writes the mission's lines from verified facts
 * (apps/api/src/services/story.rs) and they replace these defaults per trigger;
 * the defaults below still voice training and any trigger the server leaves out.
 *
 * Delivery: each line is a radio-styled subtitle + per-speaker static signature;
 * ids map 1:1 to optional VO files (public/vo/{id}.mp3) that
 * scripts/generate-vo.mjs produces when an ElevenLabs key is available. The audio
 * layer prefers the file and falls back to static-only.
